Complete the target Lean theorem file, making it sorry-free and ensuring it compiles without errors.

Use the tool `lean_diagnostic_messages` to verify the file. Errors mean "severity 1" in the response.

IMPORTANT:
- Verify the file again after each update using `lean_diagnostic_messages`.
- You may add helper lemmas, but do not create new axioms.

Tips:
- Use `simp` first, then `simp?` to get minimal simp lemmas.
- Use `native_decide` for computational results.
- Use `#eval` to evaluate expressions.
- Use `norm_cast` for type conversions.
- Use `apply?` to find applicable lemmas.
- If `decide` times out, do NOT simply increase `maxHeartbeats`. Instead, write a symbolic proof using mathematical reasoning and lemmas from Mathlib.

At the end of your response, include:
END_REASON:{reason}

where {reason} is:
- LIMIT — if stopped due to limits or there are still sorries/errors
- COMPLETE — only if the file is sorry-free AND compiles without errors

IMPORTANT: Use `lean_diagnostic_messages` to verify, do not use `lake build`.
